CC Machine EPICS Project

This was a group EPICS project done in 2022, designed to implement a text-to-speech program to run on a TV in the back of a classroom. Made to help those with hearing impairments or even those who missed a sentence or two in the back of a classroom. It was developed using Python and runs on an Orange Pi with a Blue Yeti microphone, all connected to a mobile TV stand. This project was funded by Arizona State University (ASU) at the MET Professional Academy.
